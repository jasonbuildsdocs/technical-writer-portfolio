# WebContainers Explained Simply

WebContainers are the technology that powers Bolt.new and StackBlitz. They allow Node.js applications to run entirely inside your browser—no local installation needed.

## 🧠 How It Works (Simple Explanation)
Traditional development requires:
- Installing Node.js  
- Managing dependencies  
- Running servers locally  

WebContainers replace all of this with a browser-based runtime that behaves like a lightweight virtual machine.

When you run a project in Bolt:
- A WebContainer instance launches in your browser  
- Node.js executes inside the container  
- Your app runs as if it were on a local machine

## 🔍 Why This Is Revolutionary
- No setup or installs  
- Zero dependency conflicts  
- Instant startup times  
- Safe, isolated environments  
- Perfect for classrooms, prototyping, and sharing projects  

---

## ✔ Example
When you click “Preview” in Bolt, WebContainers:
- Install npm packages  
- Build the project  
- Run the server  
- Serve the app in real-time  

All inside a tab.

## Summary
WebContainers make full-stack development accessible to anyone with a browser. They remove friction and unlock an entirely new workflow for building and sharing applications.
